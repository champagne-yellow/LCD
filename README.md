# Line-Corridor-Dataset
This is a large-scaledataset called line corridor dataset (LCD) for the study of power lines (PLs) and transmission towers (TTs) segmetation.

We hope that this dataset will help all enthusiasts and researchers of segmentation of PLs and TTs.

The work is currently under review and the LCD will be open sourced when our work is accepted.
